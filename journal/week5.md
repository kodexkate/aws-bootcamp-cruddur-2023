# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

I focused on data modelling a direct messaging system using a single table design.
Here are the steps I took:

1. Identified the data entities: I started by identifying the data entities that are needed for a direct messaging system. These entities include users, messages, and conversations.
2. Determined the relationships between entities: I then determined the relationships between these entities. For instance, a user can send and receive messages, and a message can belong to a conversation.
3. Defined the attributes for each entity: After determining the relationships, I defined the attributes for each entity. For users, attributes may include username, password, and email address. For messages, attributes may include the message content, timestamp, and sender/receiver IDs. For conversations, attributes may include conversation ID, participants, and message IDs.
4. Designed a single table schema: Instead of creating separate tables for each entity, I designed a single table schema that includes all the entities and their respective attributes. This schema would eliminate the need for complicated joins across multiple tables.
5. Normalized the data: To ensure data integrity and consistency, I normalized the data by removing any redundant or duplicate data. I ensured that each column in the table represents a single data element.
6. Tested the data model: Finally, I tested the data model by inserting sample data and running queries to ensure that the data is being stored and retrieved correctly.
