I was able to implement setup, schema-load, seed, Pattern Scripts for Read and List Conversations, and scan successfully.

## Data Modelling a Direct Messaging System using Single Table Design
--Research and study the principles of data modelling and single table design in DynamoDB
--Plan and design a data model for a direct messaging system using a single table design
--Create the table in DynamoDB based on the design


## Implementing DynamoDB query using Single Table Design
--Write queries in DynamoDB to retrieve and update data from the single table
--Test the queries and optimize their performance

## Provisioning DynamoDB tables with Provisioned Capacity
--Determine the amount of provisioned capacity needed for the table based on expected usage patterns and performance requirements
--Provision capacity for the table in DynamoDB console
--Monitor the table's capacity usage and adjust as necessary to ensure optimal performance

## Utilizing a Global Secondary Index (GSI) with DynamoDB
--Research and study the principles of GSI in DynamoDB
--Create a Global Secondary Index for the table
--Use the GSI to retrieve data in a query

## Rapid data modelling and implementation of DynamoDB with DynamoDB Local
--Install and set up DynamoDB Local 
--Develop and test applications using DynamoDB Local
--Quickly create and modify tables and data using DynamoDB Local

## Writing utility scripts to easily setup and teardown and debug DynamoDB data
--Research and study scripting languages and techniques for DynamoDB
--Write utility scripts to automate the setup and teardown of DynamoDB tables and data
--Use scripts to populate tables with sample data for testing and debugging purposes
--Debug issues with table setup or data manipulation using scripts.
